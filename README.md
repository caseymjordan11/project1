Description: 

This is a recreation of the game Simon, where a pattern is randomly shown to the user and the user must repeat the pattern back to the computer from memory.
If the correct pattern has been entered, the user is sent to the next level, where the pattern gets longer and the user must enter it again, repeated until the user incorrectly enters the pattern and the game ends.

Features: 
There are three difficulties to this game, easy, medium and hard. Easy gives the user 1 second between pattern flashes, and the pattern builds upon itself as the levels increase.
Medium builds upon itself as well, but only gives the user half a second between flashes.
Hard uses the same time interval as medium, half a second, but randomizes the pattern with each level. It does not build upon the already established pattern from prior levels. 

Technologies: 
CSS, Javascript and HTML were used to create this game. 
It is available on Github pages.
